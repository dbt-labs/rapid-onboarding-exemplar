  Once you have access, navigate to the develop tab in the menu and fill out any required information to get connected.
  
  In the command line bar at the bottom of the interface, run the following commands one at a time:
  - `dbt deps`  - installs any packages defined in the packages.yml file.
  - `dbt seed`  - builds any .csv files as tables in the warehouse. These are located in the data folder of the project.
  - `dbt run`   - builds the models found in the project into your dev schema in the warehouse.

  1. ### Install Requirements
      [Install dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation).   
      Optionally, you can [set up venv to allow for environment switching](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/setting-up-your-local-dbt-run-environments/2353). 

  2. ### Setup
      Open your terminal and navigate to your `profiles.yml`. This is in the `.dbt` hidden folder on your computer, located in your home directory.

      On macOS, you can open the file from your terminal similar to this (which is using the Atom text editor to open the file):
      ```bash
      $ atom ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
      ```

      Insert the following into your `profiles.yml` file and change out the bracketed lines with your own information.
      [Here is further documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/available-adapters#dbt-labs-supported) for setting up your profile.
      ```yaml
      my_project:                                          
       target: dev                                         
       outputs:                 
         dev:                                              
           type: [warehouse name]                                 
           threads: 8                                      
           account: [abc12345.us-west-1]                   
           user: [your_username]                           
           password: [your_password]                       
           role: transformer                               
           database: analytics                             
           warehouse: transforming

      ```
      | Configuration Key| Definition
      |-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | my_project                    | This is defining a profile - this specific name should be the profile that is referenced in our dbt_project.yml  |
      | target: dev                   | This is the default environment that will be used during our runs.                                               |
      | outputs:                      | This is a prompt to start defining targets and their configurations. You likely won't need more than `dev`, but this and any other targets you define can be used to accomplish certain functionalities throughout dbt.|
      | dev:                          | This is defining a target named `dev`.                                                                           |
      | type: [warehouse_name]        | This is the type of target connection we are using, based on our warehouse.                                      |
      | threads: 8                    | This is the amount of concurrent models that can run against our warehouse, for this user, at one time when conducting a `dbt run` |
      | account: [abc12345.us-west-1] | Change this out to the warehouse's account.                                                                      |
      | user: [your_username]         | Change this to use your own username that you use to log in to the warehouse                                     |
      | password: [your_password]     | Change this to use your own password for the warehouse                                                           |
      | role: transformer             | This is the role that has the correct permissions for working in this project.                                   |
      | database: analytics           | This is the database name where our models will build                                                            |
      | schema: dbt_[your_name]       | Change this to a custom name. Follow the convention `dbt_[first initial][last_name]`. This is the schema that models will build into / test from when conducting runs locally.|

   3. ### Running dbt
      
      Run the following commands one at a time from your command line:
      - `dbt debug` - tests your connection. If this fails, check your profiles.yml.
      - `dbt deps`  - installs any packages defined in the packages.yml file.
      - `dbt seed`  - builds any .csv files as tables in the warehouse. These are located in the data folder of the project.
      - `dbt run`   - builds the models found in the project into your dev schema in the warehouse.
